# virtual-cpu
This project came to be after I decided I needed practice finding average waiting times for CPU scheduling algorithms in my operating systems class. This program generates random "processes", runs them through a virtual CPU to calculate the average waiting time based on different scheduling algorithms, and prompts the user to solve for the average waiting time.
